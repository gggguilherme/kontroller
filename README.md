# kontroller
 
this project is -not close to being ready- 
#
so proceed with caution and a lot of things might change

# things to do so the project is ready:

## model the controller
- attitude control
- throttle control
- translation control
- button panel
- JunOS display
## electronics
- display
- potentiometers
- lots of buttons
- radio transceiver
- batteries
- battery charger
- put everything on those cool pcbs and learn to solder properly
- speaker
## code
- kRPC communication with Kerbal Space Program through arduino
- getting input from controllers and buttons
- radio transreceiver
- kOS integration

- cool sounds

# things (i'm going to) learnt with this cool project
- how to use two or more microcontrollers at the same time
- using an arduino and a raspberry Pi Pico together
- radio transceivers
- integrating 3d printed models with the electronics properly
