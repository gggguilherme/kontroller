# kontroller
 
this project is -getting on it's paces but hang in there, there's lots of work to do-
#
so proceed with caution and a lot of things might change

# things to do so the project is ready:

## model the controller
- attitude control -done
- throttle control -done
- translation control -done
- button panel -half done
- JunOS display
## electronics
- display
- potentiometers
- lots of buttons
- radio transceiver
- batteries
- battery charger
- put everything on those cool pcbs and learn to solder properly
- speaker
## code
- kRPC communication with Kerbal Space Program through arduino
- getting input from controllers and buttons
- radio transreceiver
- kOS integration
- interaction with displays through JunOS
- cool sounds

# things I'm learning with this cool project
- how to use two or more microcontrollers at the same time
- using an arduino and a raspberry Pi Pico together
- radio transceivers
- integrating 3d printed models with the electronics properly

(I took some ideas from open-joystick to design my stuff, it ended up being completely different, BUT I'd still like to share it because it's really cool and I learned a lot)
