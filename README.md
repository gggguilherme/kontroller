# kontroller
 
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
this project is -not close to being ready- 
#
so proceed with caution and a lot of things might change

# things to do so the project is ready:

## model the controller
- attitude control
- throttle control
- translation control
- button panel
- JunOS display
## electronics
- display
- potentiometers
- lots of buttons
- radio transceiver
- batteries
- battery charger
- put everything on those cool pcbs and learn to solder properly
- speaker
## code
- kRPC communication with Kerbal Space Program through arduino
- getting input from controllers and buttons
- radio transreceiver
- kOS integration
- cool sounds

# things I'm learning with this cool project
- how to use two or more microcontrollers at the same time
- using an arduino and a raspberry Pi Pico together
- radio transceivers
- integrating 3d printed models with the electronics properly

also one last thing if you don't mind:
# I'm freaking out about this:
##### repos I should reference bc I ain't no code thief of that caliber
- [kRPC](https://www.github.com/krpc/krpc)
- [Open Joystick](https://github.com/bhowiebkr/open-joystick)
(I took some ideas from this to design my stuff, it ended up being completely different, BUT I'd still like to share it)
- [kOS mod](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/KOS)
