jk jk LET'S BUILD IT BAYBE

#
something important:
you may not be able to build this exact project, as there is some electronics and parts that are not really standard from the country I live in.

something important 2:
for the first version of the project, there were a lot of decisions made just because I had the components from other projects I could reuse, in any case, in the future I assume I can improve on the project and make things MUCH more simple.

# 3D Printing
Get the .stl files from [here]("3D Models/stl")
there are a lot of different extensions of files for free use, even the .f3d files if you want do some editing!
usually, all the mechanism parts are all grouped under one file called "all.stl", under the "Attitude", "Translation", and "Throttle" folders

# Code


# Electronics


# Putting it all together
