jk jk LET'S BUILD IT BAYBE

#
something important:<br>
you may not be able to build this exact project, as there is some electronics and parts that are not really standard from the country I live in.
<br>
something important 2:<br>
for the first version of the project, there were a lot of decisions made just because I had the components from other projects I could reuse, in any case, in the future I assume I can improve on the project and make things MUCH more simple.

# 3D Printing
Get the .stl files from [here]("3D Models/stl")<br>
there are a lot of different extensions of files for free use, even the .f3d files if you want do some editing!<br>
usually, all the mechanism parts are all grouped under one file called "all.stl", under the "Attitude", "Translation", and "Throttle" folders<br>

# Code


# Electronics


# Putting it all together
