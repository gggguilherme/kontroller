there is a war going on, yes, but I'm in another continent and I can try to finish this one thing before humany blows itself up.

Modeled the throttle mechanism and enclosure
there is a high possibility that in the future, I use a regular potentiometer because it's much simpler than a whole mechanism to make it work with a sliding potentiometer, but it is what I had on my stuff at the time and it works.

don't give up now please please

the problem is that the main eletronics that will make this work didn't arrive yet, so the code and testing (fun part) didn't start and it's driving me crazy. The thing to do is to continue to 3D model and make everything work, also 3D print the parts I can test. I am downloading the 3D models of the parts I don't have so I can base my models on them.
