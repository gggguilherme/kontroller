# for devs

this is not _only_ another Kerbal Space Program controller
#
if you noticed, the bigger part of it just sends arbitrary radio signals and the _box looking thing_ connected to the computer does all the communication with the game.
#
that's intentional obviously, as I would really like to use this controller as an awesome interface for controling different projects along my long Maker path.
#
what I hope I can do in the future is just code an arduino with a radio transceiver, just like the _box looking thing_ and control different robots, drones, spaceships, basically anything just because this sends the radio signals to control stuff
#
maybe you noticed that these 'docs' are nothing for now, I really have nothing ready at this point, I STARTED THIS PROJECT A SHORT TIME AGO, OKAY?
#
these docs are really just me fantasizing of what the project will be, and also a sort of feature planner of what I want it to be.
#
I hope I can really make this right, it could be awesome :D
